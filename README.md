 Final Project for Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning course by Prof. Yeonjong Shin  

 * Topic: South Korea COVID prediction model by using PINN, SIRVD model  

### SIRVD Model
$$
\begin{cases}
{dS \over dt} = -{\beta \over N}IS + \sigma R - \alpha S \\
{dI \over dt} = +{\beta \over N}IS - \gamma I - \delta I\\
{dR \over dt} = +\gamma I -\sigma R\\
{dV \over dt} = +\alpha S\\
{dD \over dt} = +\delta I \\
\end{cases}
$$

### Datasets
From [6], we get V(t) from totalSecondCnt.  
From [5], we get I(t), R(t), D(t), and S(t) from decideCnt-clearCnt-deathCnt,  
clearCnt, deathCnt, 5174e+4-I(t)-R(t)-D(t)-V(t), respectively.  
  
Training data: training_data.csv  
Data From February 2nd, 2020 to October 31st, 2021  
Test data: testing_data.csv  
From November 1st, 2021 to December 2nd, 2021  
Both Data are composed of 6 lines and represent t, S, I, R, V, D in order.
